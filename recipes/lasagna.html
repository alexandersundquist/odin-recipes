    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <list>Gather all your ingredients.</list>
        <lsit>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</lsit>
        <list>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1
        teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</list>
        <list>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain
        noodles, and rinse with cold water.</list>
        <list>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</list>
        <list>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</list>
        <list>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over
        meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese
        slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</list>
        <list>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray
        foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</list>
        <list>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</list>
